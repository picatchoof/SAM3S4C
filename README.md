# SAM3S4C
Build a Board that will be based on ARM SAM3S4C and have almost all sensors
The main part of the system will be the Atmel ATSAM3S4CA-AU, the Sensors that will be placed on the same board will be
- The Gyroscop,
- The Compas,
- The Accelerometre,
- The Barometric and Altitude,
- The Temperature,
- Haptic Feedback,
- Motor Driver,
- Touch contact,
- And Even a Pulse Sensor (ECG),

 
The project will start by designing the schematic using Eagle Software and after it will be the PCB and next it will be the Firmware and the other test routines of each componenets.

We are waiting for you all to participate with us to properly acheive this project

Thanks a lot to you all.
